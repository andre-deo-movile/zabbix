To put this script to work, you must:

0 - Read the script. It's very short an simple. 

1 - Put above line in your crontab:
	wget --user=user --password=password http://your_icecast_address:8080/admin/stats.xml -O /tmp/stats.xml

2 - Put the script in /usr/local/bin/zabbix/icecast_stats (or where you want. After all, you are the Sysadmin, right? :-) )
	with execute permission

3 - Put the content of icecast.conf in your zabbix configuration file.

4 - Install the XML::Simple perl module. If you use Debian, this package resolve: libxml-simple-perl
	If you don't use Debian, you should use your package system or CPAN for install XML::Simple module.

5 - Create the itens inside Zabbix and watch for results. 

6 - Enjoy. :D
