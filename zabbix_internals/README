This is template I use for small, medium and large Zabbix Installs.
It show me the queue status, cache status, values per second,
Itens supported and unsupported.

I also use this template to understand my client's zabbix install  and 
determine what type of zabbix tuning  is needed. Usefull when used in 
conjunction with my or other Postgres and General Linux Server templates.

After import, go outside, take a walk or go to the near Music Instruments 
Shop and play a nice and sweet Gibson ES-335. :-)
