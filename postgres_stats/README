The script provides data collection for your PgSQL databases. 
In Zabbix template, the items started with db_prefix are for
individual database stats. For example, if you need the number of 
total commits for zabbix database, you must enter with key:
"postgres[db_commits,zabbix]" in your zabbix configuration.

To make this scripts works, you must execute some easy steps:

1 - Read the script. It's nice and I will be glad. ( Even if you don't like perl. ) 

2 - Put the script under /usr/local/bin/zabbix or in any directory,
	and don't forget to set permissions for postgres user/group.

3 - Put the bellow content inside your /etc/sudoers file:

# User Zabbix Session: needed for run some checks with Zabbix users.
zabbix           ALL = (postgres) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/zabbix/postgres_stats

4 - Install the contrib package  for postgres, and install these sqls:
	(You don't need reload the database :-) )
	pg_buffercache.sql
	pg_freespacemap.sql
	pgstattuple.sql

5 - Install the libdbi-perl and  libdbd-pg-perl packages if you use Debian/Ubuntu, 
	or install these modules using CPAN if your package system don't provides them.

6 -  Import the postgres.xml template in your zabbix installation.
	(We don't have graphs until this time).

7 - Put the content of postgres.conf in your zabbix agent configuration file. 

8 - Set the monitoring itens for global and individual databases. 

9 - Test, and send some bugs if you find one. (or corretion, who knows...) 

10 - Go outside, take a walk or some beers with someone nice.
